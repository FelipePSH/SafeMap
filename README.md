# 🛡️ Safe Map – Secure Mapping for Women

**Safe Map** is a privacy-first mobile application that enables women to share real-time alerts about dangerous areas on a collaborative map. Built with safety, community, and trust at its core, the app empowers women to protect one another by reporting unsafe locations in their cities.

---

## 🎯 Vision

In a world where public safety is unequally distributed, Safe Map offers a **female-led network of protection**, powered by verified and trusted access.

---

## 🔐 Verified Access by Invitation Only

Safe Map is not an open app — it is a **secure ecosystem**. Here's how it works:

- ✅ Only previously approved women can invite new users.
- ✅ Invites are limited and traceable.
- ✅ This avoids trolls, fake accounts, and potential threats infiltrating the community.
- ✅ Authentication is anonymous by default, with optional email or phone upgrade.
- ✅ User verification is done via Firebase + internal Firestore-based approval logic.
